Introduction
In the digital age, the ability to analyze sentiment from text data has become increasingly important. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, 
which can be classified as positive, negative, or neutral. This report outlines the steps taken to develop a sentiment analysis model using a dataset of comments. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can 
accurately classify comments as positive or negative.

1. Significance of Study and Objectives
The significance of this study lies in its potential applications across various fields such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and market research. By understanding the sentiment of comments, organizations
can gain insights into customer opinions, improve products and services, and make informed business decisions.

        1  The primary objectives of this study are:
        
        •	To preprocess and clean the text data effectively.
        
        •	To transform the text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning.
        
        •	To train a machine learning model to classify comments as positive or negative.
        
        •	To evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.

2. Data Set Explanation
   
The dataset consists of comments labeled as either positive or negative. Each comment is a piece of text that expresses an opinion.
The target variable (Target) indicates the sentiment of the comment, with 1 for positive and 0 for negative.

2.1 Text Cleaning

Text cleaning is an essential step in preprocessing text data. Raw text data often contains noise and inconsistencies that can negatively impact the performance of machine learning models. 
The following operations were applied to clean the text:

    •	Lowercasing: Lowercasing: Converting all characters to lowercase to ensure uniformity. This step is important because it makes the text case-insensitive, ensuring that 'Word' and 'word' are treated as the same token.
    
    •	Removing URLs: Eliminating web addresses to reduce noise. URLs do not contribute to sentiment and can introduce irrelevant information.
    
    •	Removing HTML tags: Stripping out any HTML tags to retain only the text content. HTML tags are not relevant for sentiment analysis and can add unnecessary complexity.
    
    •	Removing punctuation: Eliminating punctuation marks to simplify the text. Punctuation can be treated inconsistently and usually does not carry sentimental information.
    
    •	Removing newlines and extra spaces: Replacing newline characters and extra spaces with a single space.
    
    •	Removing numbers: Excluding words containing numbers to focus on textual content.
    
    •	Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form using the WordNet Lemmatizer. This step helps in normalizing words to their root form, making 'running', 'ran', and 'runs' all treated as 'run
 
2.2 Text Tokenization & Transformation

Tokenization involves splitting the cleaned text into individual words (tokens). The TfidfVectorizer was used to transform the tokenized text into numerical features.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure that evaluates the importance of a word in a document
relative to a collection of documents. This transformation converts the text into a matrix of TF-IDF features, which can be used as input for machine learning models.

 3. Word Cloud Visualization
 
Word clouds provide a visual representation of the most frequent words in the text data. Larger words indicate higher frequency. This helps in quickly identifying prominent words associated with positive and negative sentiments.

   

4. Machine Learning Classifier

The Logistic Regression model was chosen for this sentiment analysis task due to its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification problems. Logistic Regression models 
the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. The model was trained using the TF-IDF features extracted from the comments.
 
      4.1 Model Application
      
      Train Logistic Regression model was applied to predict the sentiment of comments in the test set. The predictions were then compared to the actual labels to evaluate the model's performance.
       
      4.2 Results
      
      The performance of the Logistic Regression model was evaluated using the following metrics:
      
      •	Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified comments. This metric gives an overall indication of how many comments were classified correctly.
      
      •	Confusion Matrix: A table that shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
      
      •	ROC-AUC Curve: A graphical representation of the model's performance across different threshold values, showing the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
      
      
      
      4.3 Model Performance
      
      Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 83%, indicating that it correctly classified 83% of the comments in the test set. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the Logistic Regression model.
      However, the accuracy scores do not show a significant difference.
      
       
Conclusion

In conclusion the effectiveness of using Logistic Regression for sentiment analysis. The preprocessing steps, including text cleaning and TF-IDF transformation, were crucial in preparing the data for modeling.
The Logistic Regression model showed reliable performance in classifying comments as positive or negative, with an accuracy of 83% and a ROC-AUC score of 0.85. I also tried using XGBoost to see how well the data performed with another
algorithm, but its performance was less than that of the Logistic Regression model. Therefore, I chose Logistic Regression as the best model for this task. Future work could explore the use of more complex models, such as Support Vector
Machines or deep learning techniques, to further improve classification accuracy.
